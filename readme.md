What is?
===
`sparseline` is a low resource alternative to the powerline options out there. What this means is that it only makes subtle augmentations to your prompt with a focus on git repos.


`sparseline` is written with `bash` in mind.


As of this commit, `sparseline` only prefixes your prompt with the status of the repo in the current directory (three layers deep).
